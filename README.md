# AthNFTS
NFT minting platform with front-end and hooks for auction sites. Supported by local arts agencies for local artists and musicians in Athens, GA.






Notes:
Code is based upon Minty, GITHUB:yusefnapora/minty: a minimal NFT minting platform.

Contracts are being modified to provide better authentication of provnance and additional features to better support musical works.

Most work on this project will be javascript and react to provide a front-end, hooks to interact with various auction sites and messaging with selected wallet systems.

Advanced Key Management will be added later to provide local artists with complete control of their digital assets.
